/**
 * Not sure the "start" and end field values are correct or perhaps I do not understand
 * how to use them. I ended up not using them for the purpose of locating
 * the violation text within the original copy and used a different approach.
 *
 * Also, I notice the violation fragments do not include ending punctuation,
 * yet some of the suggested corrections do include ending punctuation, which
 * forces us to address potential duplicate punctuation when injecting a
 * suggested correction into the original copy.
 *
 * For example, imagine the original copy is:
 *
 *      "Our product is very good."
 *
 * And the violation fragment is:
 *
 *      "is very good"
 *
 * If a suggested correction was:
 *
 *      "exceeds industry standards."
 *
 * And we inject the suggested correction into the original copy, without any additonal
 * text manipulation, we get:
 *
 *      "Our product exceeds industry standards.."
 *
 * Notice the extra period at the end of the final sentence.
