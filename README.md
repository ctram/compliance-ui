# Compliance Review UI

A Next.js application for reviewing and editing compliance-related content.

## Features

- Double-click copy to enter edit mode
- Original text comparison view

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Styling
- TypeScript

## Project Structure

- `/src/app` - Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `/src/components` - Reusable React components
- `/src/utils` - Helper functions and utilities

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**  
> You might need to use https, that is, navigate to https://localhost:3000,
> depending on your browser settings.
>
> The app does not support https, so you might receive a warning from your browser.
> Tell the browser you don't care and to go to the address, anyway.

## Usage

### Initial Load

The app loads a single copy to review, along with any violations found within the copy and their suggested corrections.

### Layout

The interface is split into two main panels:

- **Left Panel**: Displays the entire copy with user-chosen suggestions for violation remediation
- **Right Panel**: Shows one violation at a time with its suggested corrections

### Navigating Violations

You can move between violations in two ways:

- Use the "Prev" and "Next" buttons at the top of the right panel
- Click directly on any violation in the left panel to focus on it in the right panel

### Handling Violations

In the right panel, you can either:

- Accept the original text
- Choose one of the suggested corrections

### Manual Editing

To edit the entire copy manually:

- Double click on any non-violation text (violations are underlined)
- A text editor will appear for free-form modifications
- **Note**: Saving a manual edit will remove access to violations and their suggested corrections

### Copy Management

Several options are available to manage the copy:

- **Reset**: Revert any changes made to the copy
- **Approve**: Accept the copy in its current state (whether edited or original)
- **Cancel Approval**: Unapprove the copy and revert all changes

## Development

The project uses Next.js with the App Router and TypeScript. Components are built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Future Improvments For Consideration

- After user manually edits copy, process the edited copy again for new violations and suggested corrections.
- Support reviewing multiple copy instances.
- Violation category filtering.
- Batch approval workflow.
- Review history and audit trail.
